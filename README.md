Hello,
Iâ€™m Richard and interested in Mathematics,
Theoretical Physics and Aerospace
Engineering.
On Github I primarily pursue the
development of subroutines for Computational
Spaceflight Mechanics.
C and C++ are the languages of my choice.
I particularly often engage in software
development with OpenGL.
I also absolutely love LaTeX and to write on
Mathematics and Physics!
